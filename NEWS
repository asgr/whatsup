Took re-formatted ATCA calibrators from:

http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/calibrators/calibrator_database_search.html?rarange=0,24&decrange=-90,90

Took re-formatted GMRT calibrators from:

http://gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/~astrosupp/obs_setup/source.list

Removed explicit XML and httr dependencies. Only required for running nameresolve function, so states dependency there when run.
